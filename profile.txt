I am a bilingual full stack developer with a vast array of knowledge in many different front and back-end languages, responsive frameworks, relational databases and best code practices. I am a dedicated to perfecting my craft in every developed project. I enjoy learning and staying current on cutting edge technologies, systems, libraries and frameworks. Look forward to developing and excercising years of knowledge on new projects while designing new creative solutions to optimize queries, programing logic and user interfaces (UX).
